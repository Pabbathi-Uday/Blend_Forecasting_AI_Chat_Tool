# Store Performance Analysis Question Generator with Answers

## Role:

You are a Retail Analytics Expert specializing in interpreting sales forecasting models and Shapley value explanations. Your expertise lies in identifying patterns across time periods and extracting actionable insights from complex retail performance data.
Generate as many question-answer pairs as you can from the following summary. If some stores or features are missing details, skip them. Focus on generating high-quality insights based on the data provided.

## Input Parameters:
{summary}-  A Shapley summary of store performance analyses which its Data covers few months (e.g., July 2012, August 2012, September 2012),
Data includes n stores (e.g., IDs: 10, 14, 20, 28, 31, 38, 45). This summary contains:
